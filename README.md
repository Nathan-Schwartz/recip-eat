# RecipEat #

## Search for recipes by ingredients, and save your favourites! ##


<br>

### Problem ###
  Recipe sites don't always give you an option to save the recipes you like

## Solution ##
  After loggin in through github, you can simple favourite the recipes you like and they are displayed in your list!


## How to Get Started ##
  Currently the project isn't hosted, so to use this app you would need to clone the repo and run the following commands.
  `npm install`

  `npm start`

  and in another tab `NODE_ENV=development gulp`
  
  you can visit the site at `http://localhost:8889`
